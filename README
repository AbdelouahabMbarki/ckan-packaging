==================

Install ansible on your local machine (probably ok to do this globally)

pip install ansible

Have a bare centos box that you have ssh login too. We shall assume this machines ipaddress is 1.1.1.1

Make a hosts file /etc/ansible/hosts that has the following entry

```
[build]
1.1.1.1
```

Run the ansible playbook

ansible-playbook datagov-buildserver.yml

You may have to supply connection parameters to ansible-playbook i.e private-key or password to connect.  See ansible-playbook --help

You are asked to supply ckan version and iteration.

This should do everything and the rpm is in /var/www/
